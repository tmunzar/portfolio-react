                                    For my Masters Human-Computer Interaction Capstone Project, I designed an online learning platform for an industry client that sought to introduce the concept of certification to the independent film industry.

                                    Our clients who had experience working in the film industry presented us with the thesis that the film industry lacks a certification program, unlike other industries such as law, accounting or medicine. What would precede a certification is a learning program, and the best way to deliver teachable content these days is online.

                                    To get started, we conducted some background research via semi-structured interviews with established industry professionals that our client was kind enough to connect us to. One of them was Eduardo Sanchez, the director of the Blair Witch Project!

                                    The purpose of this research was to immerse ourselves in the workings of the film industry before we set out to research and design a learning platform catered to it.

                                    The film industry is already a tight-knit peoples' business, with outsiders having a tough time accessing it. It was even harder to get access to a group of students. Despite our client providing us with some help, we were mostly left on our own to recruit the right kind of end-users for our research.

                                So we decided to explore users in contexts similar to what we were building. We decided to also reach out to people from other creative professions who needed to learn the business and technical skills to succeed in their industry.
